# react-cv-app

## About

This app is a job application app that allows the user to input their information, education, and work positions and submit the application when completed.
Users can navigate through the app using the left and right arrow buttons.
Each form must be saved before switching pages.

### Things I learned

- How to create and structure a react app
- Creating a maintainable and clear project structure
- Using and setting state to store form information
- Using javascript to do form and input validation, and using styling to convey invalid or valid inputs
- Using useReducer instead of state for multiple handlers
